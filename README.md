# Solar System Data

This is an example [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)-dataset that contains the solar system's planets and their moons.
For old times' sake, dwarf planet Pluto is also included.
All data is generated by [queries](queries) to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) and then converted by a Python script.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* libraries in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Creating the Dataset

```
% python -m venv venv
% . venv/bin/activate
(venv) âˆš solar-system-data % pip install -r requirements.txt
